# Backbone Determination of Wireless Sensor Networks.

This is a visualized algorithm engineering work of backbone determination algorithms of wireless sensor networks.

We model a wireless sensor network by constructing a random geometric graph, then partition the graph into a collection of disjoint bipartite subgraphs as backbones.

The program manual is: https://github.com/zizhenc/WSNdoc/blob/main/Docmentation.pdf
